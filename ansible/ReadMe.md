# Scan host configuration using ansible
    Version: 1.0

## Description
- This utility installs and configures the prerequisites required to run a malware scan on the scan host (RHEL (8.x, 9.x) / Windows Server 2016 and above).
- Additionally, this utility can be used to install `NetBackup Malware Scanner` on the scan host.
- The following would be installed/configured by the utility on the scan hosts (requires internet connectivity)
    1. Linux scan hosts:
        <ul>
        <li>Prerequisites installed: libnsl, NFS client, SMB client. </li>
        <li>Configuration: Non root user creation. </li>
        </ul>
    2. Windows scan hosts:
        <ul>
        <li> Prerequisites installed: OpenSSH, NFS-Client, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe"> VC Runtime </a>. </li>
        <li> Configurations: Non-administrator user creation. </li>
        </ul>

## Prerequisites to be present on the ansible controller node (node on which this utility runs)
- RHEL Version = 8.x, 9.x
- ansible      = 2.16.2 and above
- python       = 3.11.x (required to run ansible 2.16.x)
- sshpass      = 1.x
- pywinrm      = 0.4.x
- requests     = 2.31.x (optional)
- SSH must be allowed to the `ansible_user` in case of linux scan hosts.
- Winrm connectivity should be allowed to the `ansible_user` in case of windows hosts.

> **_NOTE:_** Run `install_ansible.sh` for installing above prerequisites on the ansible controller node.

## Steps to configure scan host
```
1. Clone the repository from GitHub and move it to your Ansible Control Host:
    git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/netbackup-scanhost-config.git
2. By default, the host key checking would happen before configuring the scan host.
    To add the fingerprint of the scan host for Linux hosts, perform the following:
        1. `ssh-keyscan -H {{HOST}} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` or manually perform SSH to the scan host.
3. Provide the scan host details in the `inventory/hosts.yml` file. Refer `Terminologies` section for the complete list of options.
    `install_avira`: Installs avira if set to `True`, defaults to False.
    `avira_package_path`:(Optional) Local absolute path to the `NetBackup Malware Scanner` zip package (NBAntimalwareClient) which is available on the Veritas download center.
    `ansible_user`: scan host username, This user should be a user with root/Administrator privileges.
    `ansible_ssh_pass`: scan host password.
4. Run the following command to run the playbook
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml
5. Use credentials displayed at the end of script to register the scan host to netbackup primary server.
```
