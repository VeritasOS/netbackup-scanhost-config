# Scan host configuration using shell
    Version: 1.0

## Description
- This utility installs and configures the prerequisites required to run a malware scan on the scan host (RHEL (8.x, 9.x) / SUSE 12 and above).
- Additionally, this utility can be used to install `NetBackup Malware Scanner` on the scan host.
- The following would be installed/configured by the utility on the scan hosts
    <ul>
    <li>Prerequisites installed: libnsl, NFS client, SMB client. </li>
    <li>Configuration: Non root user creation. </li>
    </ul>
- By default this script runs as checker and verifies all the things required for malware scan to run. To install all the prerequisites use `--install` flag.

## Initial prerequisites to be present on the scan host
- RHEL Version = 8.x, 9.x
- Subscription manager attached
- Internet connectivity required
- Uses `jq` for parsing the `inputs.json` file
- Default login shell should be `bash`

## Steps to configure scan host

    git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/netbackup-scanhost-config.git
2. Provide the scan host details in the `inputs.json` file. Refer `Terminologies` section for the complete list of options.
    `install_avira`: Installs avira if set to `True`, defaults to False.
    `avira_package_path`:(Optional) Local absolute path to the `NetBackup Malware Scanner` zip package (NBAntimalwareClient) which is available on the Veritas download center.

| scan_user           | scanuser                                | The user will be created if it does not exist on the scan host and NetBackup Malware Scanner will be configured using the same user|
| scan_group          | scangroup                               | This group would be created on the requested host if it does not exist and `scan_user` will be added in the same group |
