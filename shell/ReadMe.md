# Scan host configuration using shell
    Version: 1.0

## Description
- NetBackup footprint is not required on the scan host.
- This utility installs and configures the prerequisites required to run a malware scan on the scan host (RHEL (8.x, 9.x) / SUSE 12 and above).
- Additionally, this utility can be used to install `NetBackup Malware Scanner` on the scan host.
- The following will be installed/configured by the utility on the scan hosts.
    *  NFS client
    *  SMB client
    * Configuration: Non-root user creation
- By default, this script runs as a checker and verifies all the things required for a malware scan to run. To install all the prerequisites use `--install` flag.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that the following prerequisites are present on the scan host.
- RHEL Version = 8.x, 9.x
- Subscription manager attached
- Internet connectivity required
- Uses `jq` for parsing the `inputs.json` file
- Default login shell should be `bash`

## Steps to configure scan host
1. Clone the repository from GitHub and move it to your scan host.
    * `git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/netbackup-scanhost-config.git`
2. Traverse to `netbackup-scanhost-config\shell`. (`cd netbackup-scanhost-config\shell`)
3. Provide the required inputs in the `inputs.json` file. Refer `Terminologies` section for the complete list of inputs.
    * `install_avira`: Installs `NetBackup Malware Scanner` if set to `true`, defaults to `false`.
    * `avira_package_path`: (Required only if `install_avira` is set to `true`) Local absolute path to the `NetBackup Malware Scanner` zip package (NBAntimalwareClient) which is available on the Veritas download center.
4. Run the following command.
    * `sh configure-scanhost.sh [--verbose] [--install]`
5. Use credentials displayed at the end of the script to register the scan host to netbackup primary server.

| scan_group          | scangroup                               | This group would be created on the requested host if it does not exist and `scan_user` will be added in the same group               |
