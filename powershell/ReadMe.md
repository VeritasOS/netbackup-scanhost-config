    Version: 1.0

## Description

- This utility installs and configures the prerequisites required to run a malware scan on the scan host (Windows Server 2016 and above).
- Additionally, this utility can be used to install `NetBackup Malware Scanner` on the scan host.
- The following would be installed/configured by the utility on the scan host
    * [OpenSSH-v9.4.0.0p1-Beta](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/download/v9.4.0.0p1-Beta/OpenSSH-Win64.zip)
    * NFS-Client
    * [VC Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
    * Configurations: Non-administrator user creation

## Prerequisites
Ensure that the following prerequisites are present on the scan host
- Windows Server Version = 2016 and above
- Internet connectivity required

## Steps to configure scan host
1. Clone the repository from GitHub and move it to your scan host.
    * `git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/netbackup-scanhost-config.git`
2. Open `powershell.exe` as Administrator. Traverse to `netbackup-scanhost-config\powershell`. (`cd netbackup-scanhost-config\powershell`)
3. Provide the required inputs in the `inputs.json` file. Refer `Terminologies` section for the complete list of inputs.
    * `install_avira`: Installs `NetBackup Malware Scanner` if set to `true`, defaults to `false`.
    * `avira_package_path`: (Required only if `install_avira` is set to `true`) Local absolute path to the `NetBackup Malware Scanner` zip package (NBAntimalwareClient) which is available on the Veritas download center.
4. Run the following command
    * `.\configure-scanhost.ps1 [--install] [--check] [--h/--help]`
5. Use credentials displayed at the end of the script to register the scan host to netbackup primary server.
